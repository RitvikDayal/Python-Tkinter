## Scientific_Calculator-Python-Tkinter
Thsi calculator is purely coded in python and works by using different python libraries such as 'math', 'Tkinter', 'tkinter.messagebox', 'Parser'. It can work in two modes:-
1. Standard Mode (Default mode)
2. Scientific Mode

By default the application starts in 'standard mode' in order to aces the scientific mode one can navigate through 'File>Scientific Calculator'. The scientific calculator can be used for the calculations using lograthim function, exponential function, trignomrtric functions etc.

Being an amature at programming I have tried to develope some intresting and simple GUIs application using python.
I welcome all types of suggestions and correction that can be made possible.

I wish if my code can help you with something so, feel free to use the tkinter code in any way you want just all I want is a little credit.:-)

Thank you.
